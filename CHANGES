Changes in 3.0.0

   These are mostly ABI breaking changes.
   In few cases the API also changed, but the most external one
   (the one documented) should be unchanged.

- WKT parser speedup
- New WKB parser
- Optimizations: function inlining, Coordinate copies reduction,
  dynamic allocations reduction
- Higher dimensions support for CoordinateSequence
- Changed SegmentNode to contain a *real* Coordinate (not a pointer)
  to reduce construction costs.
- Cached number of points in Edge
- Changed geomgraph nodeMap to use Coordinate pointers as keys
- Envelope destructor made non-virtual to give compiler more static
  binding options.
- Changed BufferSubgraph::computeDepths to use a set instead of a vector
  for checking visited Edges.

Changes in 2.1.2

- Segfault fix in Point::isEmpty
- Mem Leak fix in OffsetCurveBuilder::getRingCurve
- Bugfix in LineSegment::reverse
- Added multipolygon buffering test in source/test/testLeaksBig
- Ported JTS robustness patch for RobustLineIntersector
- Removed useless Coordinate copies in OverlayOp::mergeZ()
- Avoided throws by IsValid on invalid input
- Stricter C++ syntax (math.h=>cmath, ieeefp.h in "C" block, ostringstream
  instead of sprintf)
- Better support for older compilers (Polygonizer::LineStringAdder friendship)
- Removed useless Coordinate copies in CGAlgorithms::isOnLine()
- Added support for polygonize and parametrized buffer tests in XMLTester
- Fixed support for --includedir and --libdir
- Fixed Z interpolation in LineIntersector
- Handled NULL results from getCentroid() in XMLTester
- Segfault fix in (EMPTY)Geometry::getCentroid()
- Made polygon::getBoundary() always OGC-valid (no LinearRings)
- Input checking and promoting in GeometryFactory::createMultiLineString()
- Segfault fix in GeometryEditor::editPolygon()
