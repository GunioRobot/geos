1: Increment CAPI_INTERFACE_X in configure.in
   - For a release with no interface changes just bump REVISION.
     [ Even if *nothing* changed in CAPI ]
   - Adding interfaces, bump CURRENT/AGE, set REVISION to 0.
   - Deleting interfaces / compatibility issues - bump CURRENT, others to zero
     [ THIS MUST BE CAREFULLY AVOIDED ]

2: Increment release version:
   - In configure.in
   - In source/headers/geos/version.h.vc
   - In capi/geos_c.h.in
     - VERSION_PATCH for bugfixes/improvements (even breaking C++ API)
     - VERSION_MINOR for NEW interfaces in the C lib
     - VERSION_MAJOR for SUBSTANTIAL additions or C lib ABI break
       [ THIS MUST BE CAREFULLY AVOIDED ]
   
3: Run 'make distcheck', fix any problem with it.

4: Generate the ChangeLog by running 'make cl'

5: Update the NEWS file (extract most important things from the ChangeLog)

6. Commit the new ChangeLog and NEWS files.

7: Tag the release:
   $ base=http://svn.osgeo.org/geos/
   $ svn copy -m "Tagged release MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH" \
		$base/trunk $base/tags/MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
