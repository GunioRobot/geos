1.4.0

	- Added geos.h for quick inclusion

	- Added geos_version.h with version numbers and string defines

	- All geometry constructors have now deep-copy version
	  (pass-by-pointer) and a take-ownership version (pass-by-ref).
	  This interface is available for GeometryFactory as well
	  including buildGeometry.
