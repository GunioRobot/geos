2.1.1
	- WKT parsing speedup - curtesy of Cheng Shan

	- Fixed a bug in IsValid throwing exception on some invalid inputs

	- New args for geos-config: --includedir and --libdir

	- Optimizations:
		- reduction of Coordinate copies
		- more inlines
		- reduced ->size, ->getSize calls in loops
		- caching of number of points in Edge
		- BufferSubgraph interface changed to use
		  set<> instead of vector<>
		- Envelope made a concrete class

	- Few memory faults fixes.

	- New features of XMLTester:
		- polygonize test 
		- point-per-quadrant arg for buffer test

	- removal of standard C lib headers dependencies.

2.1.0
	- Added Polygonizer and LineMerger classes.

	- python wrapper examples

	- General cleanup / warnings removal

	- cleaner win32 / older copilers builds

	- Reduced heap allocations

	- debian package builder scripts

	- reduction of standard C lib headers dependency

	- Z support in overlay operations.

2.0.0

	- CoordinateList renamed to CoordinateSequence, BasicCoordinateList
	  renamed to DefaultCoordinateSequence to reflect JTS changes.
	  DefaultCoordinateSequenceFactory and CoordinateSequenceFactory
	  got same interface as JTS.

	- Added geos/version.h defining versioning infos

	- Added geos.h for quick inclusion. It will include geos/geom.h,
	  new geos/version.h, geos/util.h geos/io.h and geos/unload.h
	  (geometry input/output, exceptions, operations).

	- Added a geos::version() function showing GEOS and equivalent
	  JTS versions as strings.

	- All geometry constructors take ownership of given arguments.
	  GeometryFactory provides pass-by-reference geometry creators
	  to take care of a deep-copy.

	- GeometryFactory::createMultiPoint(const CoordinateList *)
	  has been renamed to
	  GeometryFactory::createMultiPoint(const CoordinateList &)
	  to reflect copy semantic

	- GeometryFactory: EMPTY geometry creation do now have their
	  own constructors taking no arguments.

	- Geometry constructors taking PrecisionModel and SRID have
	  been dropped. You have to use GeometryFactory instead.

	- WKTWriter default constructor has been dropped. You need
	  to initialize it with an explicit GeometryFactory
