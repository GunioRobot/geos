2.1.0
	- Added Polygonizer and LineMerger classes.

2.0.0

	- CoordinateList renamed to CoordinateSequence, BasicCoordinateList
	  renamed to DefaultCoordinateSequence to reflect JTS changes.
	  DefaultCoordinateSequenceFactory and CoordinateSequenceFactory
	  got same interface as JTS.

	- Added geos/version.h defining versioning infos

	- Added geos.h for quick inclusion. It will include geos/geom.h,
	  new geos/version.h, geos/util.h geos/io.h and geos/unload.h
	  (geometry input/output, exceptions, operations).

	- Added a geos::version() function showing GEOS and equivalent
	  JTS versions as strings.

	- All geometry constructors take ownership of given arguments.
	  GeometryFactory provides pass-by-reference geometry creators
	  to take care of a deep-copy.

	- GeometryFactory::createMultiPoint(const CoordinateList *)
	  has been renamed to
	  GeometryFactory::createMultiPoint(const CoordinateList &)
	  to reflect copy semantic

	- GeometryFactory: EMPTY geometry creation do now have their
	  own constructors taking no arguments.

	- Geometry constructors taking PrecisionModel and SRID have
	  been dropped. You have to use GeometryFactory instead.

	- WKTWriter default constructor has been dropped. You need
	  to initialize it with an explicit GeometryFactory
