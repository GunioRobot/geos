- speedup in BufferSubgraph::computeDepths (read comment there)

- PrecisionModel nearbyint() check

- doc/example.cpp: check side location conflict on intersection
  GEOS Exception (intersecting 0 and 3: TopologyException: side location conflict (0,250)

- Add class for use in Geometry::userData setting.

- make GeometryFactory->createMULTI*() consistent in taking

  either:
  	const vector<const Geometry *>
	(copy all)
  or:
  	vector<Geometry *>
	(copy none)

  right now they take:
  	const vector<Geometry *>
	(copy vector, get Geometry ownership)
  
- Remove all explicit heap allocations for private static members.
