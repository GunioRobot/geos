- make GeometryFactory->createMULTI*() consistent in taking
  const vector<const Geometry *>. All constructors should
  make copies of given args instead of keeping the real thing.
  It will take longer to copy entire objects than simple pointers 
  but callers will be able to use goemetries as arguments to 
  multiple constructors and won't be left with pointers to
  private areas.
  GeometryCollection does not take a 'const vector<Geometry *>'
  In order to allow for a 'const vector<const Geometry *>' we need
  to be able to easly copy a Geometry object. Right now copy
  constructor will not do since the compiler will not let us
  allocate space for a Geometry (contains abstract methods).
  Inspect possible resolutions. --strk;

- Inspect on the opportunity of giving LineString->points public
  access for performance speedup. The only way you can change it
  right now is by getting a copy, modify it and copying it back
  with setPoints().
