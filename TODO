- CORRECTNESS:
	- hunt for a possible uninitialized memory bug
	  (robustness.xml tests act differently when
	   built with or w/out USE_INLINE)

- BUILD SPEEDUP:
	- build a single library rather then one for each dir

- WKB tester in doc/examples.cpp should do point-by-point comparison.

- Implement Safe's idea of a compile-time enabled 2d-only
  inlineable CoordinateSequence

- WKB extension with LINEARRIN ?

- DoubleBits misregards BYTE_ENDIAN, must check it.

- Have IsValidOp handle all possible exceptions thrown by
  GeometryGraph constructor (currently only with Polygon this
  is true).

- Add distinct binary predicates test support in XMLTester

- Check how to disable GEOS_VERSION define on command line
  (or make GEOS_VERSION define in version.h optional)
  not a major problems, just makes the compiler issue some warninigs.

- Check GeometryEditor behaviour (modify passed geom or create a new one ?)
  [not documented]

- Remove all explicit heap allocations for private static members.
