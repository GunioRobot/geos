SWIG generated GEOS module
==========================

Manifest
--------

The main interface file is geos.i.  Makefiles and specific instructions for
target languages will be found in directories named for the target language.
Currently Ruby and Python are the only languages supported, but the SWIG
files should work with perl and tcl. Contributions are welcome.


Compiling
---------
Each language provides a pre-generated SWIG wrapper file which is
called geos_wrap.cxx.  Compile this file and link it against the
appropriate shared libaries to create an extension for Ruby or
Python.  For more information on how to build extensions, please
see the Ruby or Python documentation.

Note that these binding link directly against the GEOS C++ API, and not
the GEOS C API.  As a result, the language extension must be built using
the same compiler you used to build GEOS itself.


Generating Module Source
------------------------

If you have SWIG 1.3.28 or later installed you can regenerate the SWIG
wrapper files (geos_wrap.cxx).  To do this change to the target 
language directory, and type:

    $ swig -c++ -TARGET_LANG -o geos_wrap.cxx ../geos.i

Make sure to check the language specific files for information that
may supercede these instructions.


Installation
------------

See the SWIG documentation

  http://www.swig.org/Doc1.3/SWIGPlus.html#n5

for guidance on building the _geos shared library for any language.  Python
users should read python/INSTALL.txt and use the python/setup.py distutils
script.


Usage
-----

The module generated by SWIG will have an API very much like the C++ API,
but with a flattened namespace.
